*   11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")
*   12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)

###Other attributes:

*   13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
*   14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)

##Output variable (desired target)

*   17 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")

It should be stressed that due to internal competition and current financial crisis, there are huge pressures for European banks to increase a financial asset. To solve this issue, one adopted strategy is offer attractive long-term deposit applications with good interest rates, in particular by using directed marketing campaigns. Also, the same drivers are pressing for a reduction in costs and time. Thus, there is a need for an improvement in efficiency: lesser contacts should be done, but an approximately number of successes (clients subscribing the deposit) should be kept.
